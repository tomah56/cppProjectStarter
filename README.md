Simple classmaker for 42 cpp projects. I only finished my 00 so be gentle with judging the code :D

How to use:
First argument takes the path where you want to create the files. ("./" or "./anyfolder/here")
Second, third... is the name of the Classes you want to create. (as many as you can type)
The app will also create a main with includes of classes and a simple makefile.

Example:

./makeclasses.out ./test FirstClass SecondClass NotLastClass
