rules of use: first argument is the path you want to create the files, second, third... is the name of the Classes you want to create. Will create also a main with include of classes and a simple makefile.

Example:

./makeclasses.out ./cpp00/ex05 FirstClass SecondClass ThirdClass

Use it, shape it, enjoy it
